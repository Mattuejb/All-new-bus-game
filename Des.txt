I want to create a whole new bus game that is a modern bug-free game that rivals omsi 2 in functionality. 
I want it to be open source and that anyone can play, but I need your help. 
I don't know much about creating a game or any element of it so I'm looking for people who want to help.
Any help for example advice on should we use an existing game engine or create one from scratch.
